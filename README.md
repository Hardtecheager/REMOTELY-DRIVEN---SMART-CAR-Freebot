# REMOTELY-DRIVEN---SMART-CAR-Freebot
This project describes the development of a Wi-Fi controlled car equipped with live video streaming capabilities for surveillance applications
 
##The car utilizes an ESP32 Dev Module for processing and Wi-Fi communication, a motor driver for movement control, and a Lithium-Ion battery for extended operation. An Internet Protocol (IP) webcam mounted on the car captures live video footage of the surroundings, which is then streamed and potentially processed using Python code running on a separate device. This project offers a practical introduction to building a mobile surveillance platform, combining concepts of microcontroller programming, Wi-Fi communication, and video processing with Python. The project provides a foundation for further development, allowing for customization and integration of additional features to enhance its surveillance capabilities
